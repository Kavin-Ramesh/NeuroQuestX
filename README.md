# NeuroQuestX
NeuroQuest is a gamified cognitive-wellness app using clinically backed memory and navigation mini-games to track subtle cognitive changes. Drawing on research in early Alzheimer’s markers, it turns validated tasks into short daily challenges and logs performance trends to help users monitor brain health.

Built as a collection of fast, fun, replayable mini-games, NeuroQuest converts clinically established tasks (e.g., wayfinding, object-location recall, N-back, face-name associative tasks) into a lightweight mobile experience.

The app aggregates gameplay metrics (accuracy, path deviation, memory span, reaction-time variability, error types, and longitudinal drift) into a personalized Cognitive Wellness Score, enabling safe, non-clinical monitoring of cognitive trends over weeks and months.

Features include:

🎮 Multi-domain cognitive mini-games

🧭 Spatial navigation tasks inspired by research (Sea Hero Quest, Coughlan 2018)

🧠 Associative memory challenges modeled after FNAME paradigms

🔢 Working-memory tasks (N-back-style)

⚡ Processing-speed + reaction-time variability tracking

📈 Longitudinal cognitive trend analysis

🌟 Streaks, XP, and gamified progression

🔒 100% private, on-device gameplay metrics

NeuroQuest is not a diagnostic app—it is a wellness and monitoring tool backed by evidence-based cognitive science.
