NeuroQuest is a gamified cognitive-wellness app using clinically backed memory and navigation mini-games to track subtle cognitive changes. Drawing on research in early Alzheimer’s markers, it turns validated tasks into short daily challenges and logs performance trends to help users monitor brain health.
